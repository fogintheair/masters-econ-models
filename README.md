## 2. DCC-GARCH (R)

This section is for backup purposes only.

The script `during_covid-19_DCC.R` contains my working notes from applying the DCC-GARCH model during the COVID-19 period. It represents a snapshot of the modeling process at the time and is **not** a fully cleaned or reproducible analysis pipeline.

This is simply a working version I had back then ‚Äî uploaded here for safekeeping and future reference.
